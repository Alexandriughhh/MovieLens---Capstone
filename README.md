# MovieLens Capstone Project ðŸŽ¬

This project builds a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens 10M dataset and regularized linear models in R.

## Files Included

- `Capstone.R` â€“ Full R script for data cleaning, modeling, and evaluation
- `MovieLens_Project.Rmd` â€“ Annotated R Markdown notebook
- `MovieLens_Capstone.pdf` â€“ Final report with visualizations and results
- `README.md` â€“ Overview of the project

## Highlights

- Built a recommender system using user and movie effects
- Applied regularization and lambda tuning to reduce RMSE
- Compared models with and without user effects
- Visualized trends over time and genre differences
